Android and React Native Comparison

## Differences between React Native and Android Studio:
# React Native
 - Works with both iOS and Android App development
 - Does not come with a built-in IDE
 - Works primarily through the terminal. 
 - Still requires having Android Studio downloaded to function.
 - Works primarily with Javascript.
 - Does not work with every library.

# Android Studio
 - Offers an integrated IDE that provides a GUI for the user to work with.
 - Much simpler for those who are new to application development and coding. 
 - Able to use Kotlin, which is similar to Java. 
 - Provides the most up to date android updates. 
 - Is not compatible with iOS. 
 
## Overview of the Installation Process and Example Application
Both of the above applications are the corresponding "Hello world" displaying applications. The goal of these tutorials were to help the user download and install the development software and create their first application. 

One negative about React Native is that it requires many additional steps to setup on ones computer. On top of installing android studio the user must configure everything correctly or else react native will be unable to work. It took a significantly longer time to setup react native and have it run properly compared to just getting android studio to work. 

Next, in terms of android emulators, if a user does not have a intel chip, like myself and use AMD instead, has to go through several hurdles to get the emulator to work. This could have been a setup error, but android studio was able to work with my manually plugged in device, but react native had a hard time detecting it. 

Lastly, both applications were able to produce an application that works on my device and printed hello world. 

To conclude, I believe for a user that is new to application development and coding, working with android studio first may be more helpful than starting with react native. React native, however, may be a lot simpler that android studio for those who are already familiar with java.
